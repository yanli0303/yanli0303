I'm a full-stack web developer who leans toward front-end and is passionate about empowering people with technology.

- I'm very interested in making applications in JavaScript, with libraries and tools like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [CSS-in-JS](https://cssinjs.org/), [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
- I like the expressive syntax of the [Swift](https://swift.org/) programming language, I coded with Swift for three years and developed macOS desktop applications with it.
- I used to develop web applications in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and was impressed by the pragmatic design of the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.
- In the first few years of my career, I made a few web applications with [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet).
